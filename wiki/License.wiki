#summary GMOgre3D license

= GMOgre3D License =
GMOgre3D is released under the GNU Lesser Public License (LGPL).  What this means is that you are free to use GMOgre3D in both your non-commercial and commercial games, royalty free.  You just need to include the GMOgre3D license and copyright in any software you release that uses GMOgre3D.

Also, since GMOgre3D uses the LGPL license you get the full source code to GMOgre3D and can modify this for your own needs.  However, if you do modify the source code to GMOgre3D you must make your modified GMOgre3D source code publically, and freely, available for others to download.  This ensures that everyone benefits from the changes you make to GMOgre3D!

Note that GMOgre3D statically links to both the OGRE and MOC libraries, which use the LGPL and MIT license respectively.  The MIT license has the same restrictions I stated above, except it does not require that you release the source code if you make changes.  Below are the full licenses for all 3rd party libraries included in GMOgre3D.

Note that GMOgre3D statically links to both the OGRE, GMAPI, SkyX, and MOC libraries.  The first three also use the LGPL license and the last uses the MIT license.  The MIT license has even less restrictions in that it doesn't require that you release the source code if you make changes.  Below are the full license for GMOgre3D and all 3rd party libraries included in GMOgre3D.
