#summary Overview of font scripts.

= Font Definition Scripts =
GMOgre uses texture-based fonts to render the !TextAreaOverlayElement. You can also use the Font object for your own purpose if you wish. The final form of a font is a Material object generated by the font, and a set of 'glyph' (character) texture coordinate information.

There are 2 ways you can get a font into GMOgre:
   # Design a font texture yourself using an art package or font generator tool.
   # Ask GMOgre to generate a font texture based on a truetype font. 

The former gives you the most flexibility and the best performance (in terms of startup times), but the latter is convenient if you want to quickly use a font without having to generate the texture yourself. I suggest prototyping using the latter and change to the former for your final solution.

All font definitions are held in .fontdef files, which are parsed by the system at startup time. Each .fontdef file can contain multiple font definitions. The basic fomat of an entry in the .fontdef file is:
{{{
<font_name>
{
    type <image | truetype>
    source <image file | truetype font file>
    ...
    ... custom attributes depending on type
}
}}}

= Using an existing font texture =
If you have one or more artists working with you, no doubt they can produce you a very nice font texture. OGRE supports full colour font textures, or alternatively you can keep them monochrome / greyscale and use TextArea's colouring feature. Font textures should always have an alpha channel, preferably an 8-bit alpha channel such as that supported by TGA and PNG files, because it can result in much nicer edges. To use an existing texture, here are the settings you need:
  * _type_ _image_ - This just tells OGRE you want a pre-drawn font. 
  * _source_ _filename_ - This is the name of the image file you want to load. This will be loaded from the standard resource locations and can be of any type GMOgre supports, although JPEG is not recommended because of the lack of alpha and the lossy compression. I recommend PNG format which has both good lossless compression and an 8-bit alpha channel. 
  * _glyph_ _character_ _u1_ _v1_ _u2_ _v2_ - This provides the texture coordinates for the specified character. You must repeat this for every character you have in the texture. The first 2 numbers are the x and y of the top-left corner, the second two are the x and y of the bottom-right corner. Note that you really should use a common height for all characters, but widths can vary because of proportional fonts.
  'character' is either an ASCII character for non-extended 7-bit ASCII, or for extended glyphs, a unicode decimal value, which is identified by preceding the number with a 'u' - e.g. 'u0546' denotes unicode value 546. 

A note for Windows users: I recommend using !BitmapFontBuilder (http://www.lmnopc.com/bitmapfontbuilder/), a free tool which will generate a texture and export character widths for you, you can find a tool for converting the binary output from this into 'glyph' lines in the Tools folder.

= Generating a font texture =
You can also generate font textures on the fly using truetype fonts. I don't recommend heavy use of this in production work because rendering the texture can take a several seconds per font which adds to the loading times. However it is a very nice way of quickly getting text output in a font of your choice.

Here are the attributes you need to supply:
  * _type_ _truetype_ - Tells GMOgre to generate the texture from a font 
  * _source_ _ttf_ _file_ - The name of the ttf file to load. This will be searched for in the common resource locations and in any resource locations added via !AddResourceLocation. 
  * _size_ _size_in_points_ - The size at which to generate the font, in standard points. Note this only affects how big the characters are in the font texture, not how big they are on the screen. You should tailor this depending on how large you expect to render the fonts because generating a large texture will result in blurry characters when they are scaled very small (because of the mipmapping), and conversely generating a small font will result in blocky characters if large text is rendered. 
  * _resolution_ _dpi_ - The resolution in dots per inch, this is used in conjunction with the point size to determine the final size. 72 / 96 dpi is normal. 
  * _antialias_colour_ _true_|_false_ - This is an optional flag, which defaults to 'false'. The generator will antialias the font by default using the alpha component of the texture, which will look fine if you use alpha blending to render your text (this is the default assumed by TextAreaOverlayElement for example). If, however you wish to use a color based blend like add or modulate in your own code, you should set this to 'true' so the color values are anitaliased too. If you set this to true and use alpha blending, you'll find the edges of your font are antialiased too quickly resulting in a 'thin' look to your fonts, because not only is the alpha blending the edges, the colour is fading too. Leave this option at the default if in doubt. 
  * _code_points_ _nn_-_nn_ ... - This directive allows you to specify which unicode code points should be generated as glyphs into the font texture. If you don't specify this, code points 33-166 will be generated by default which covers the basic Latin 1 glyphs. If you use this flag, you should specify a space-separated list of inclusive code point ranges of the form 'start-end'. Numbers must be decimal. 

You can also create new fonts at runtime by using the !Font functions if you wish.
