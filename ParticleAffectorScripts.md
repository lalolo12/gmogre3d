## Particle Affectors ##
Particle affectors modify particles over their lifetime. They are classified by 'type' e.g. 'LinearForce' affectors apply a force to all particles, whilst 'ColourFader' affectors alter the colour of particles in flight. New affectors can be added to Ogre by creating plugins. You add an affector to a system by nesting another section within it, headed with the keyword 'affector' followed by the name of the type of affector (case sensitive). Ogre currently supports 'LinearForce' and 'ColourFader' affectors.

Particle affectors actually have no universal attributes; they are all specific to the type of affector.
