# Welcome #
Thanks for checking out GMOGre3D, a GM port of the extremely popular open source OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) 3D engine. Why port OGRE to Game Maker? Simply put, the 3D support built into Game Maker only supports the most very basic of 3D functionality. If you want to get the most of your 3D games using Game Maker then you need to use a 3rd party graphics library, such as OGRE.

I choose to port OGRE in particular because it's an extremely popular 3D engine that is constantly being updated and improved upon. It also has an extremely large, passionate, and active user base.

Please take a look around, you won't be disappointed!
